# ArduSoar

Autonomous thermal soaring built on **ArduPilot's ArduSoar controller**
([docs](https://ardupilot.org/plane/docs/soaring.html)). See [`proposal.md`](proposal.md)
for the full direction. (Originally inspired by `sahil-kale/autoglide`; see
Attribution below.)

## Direction

We no longer build our own flight controller. ArduPilot's ArduSoar already solves
the **tactical** problem brilliantly — once the aircraft is in rising air, centre
the thermal and climb. What it can't do is know **where today's thermals are**.
That **strategic** problem is our differentiator, and it's driven by real weather.

```
 Strategic layer (this repo)              Tactical layer (ArduSoar, onboard)
 ----------------------------             ----------------------------------
 weather forecast -> thermal prior        detect lift, enter THERMAL,
 pick today's best hotspot                centre the core, climb
 fly the aircraft there (MAVLink)   -->   ArduSoar takes the handoff
```

## Asset groups

### 1. Active — the strategic differentiator
| Dir | Role |
|---|---|
| [`weather/`](weather/) | **Core.** SoaringMeteo GFS grabber + Open-Meteo Deardorff W\* pipeline → thermal-velocity / cloud-base / wind **prior**. "Where are today's thermals." |
| [`companion/`](companion/README.md) | **MAVLink bridge.** Reads the prior, picks the best reachable hotspot, flies the aircraft there, hands off to ArduSoar. **Working end-to-end in SITL.** |
| [`sitl/`](sitl/README.md) | **ArduSoar reproduction.** Drives ArduPilot SITL's ArduSoar over MAVLink with zero hardware (Milestone 1). |

### 2. Kept tooling
| Dir | Role |
|---|---|
| [`navigation/`](navigation/) | Strategic belief map + value-based commit decision. **Reused by `companion/`** (`thermal_prior.BeliefMap`, `decision.worth_climbing`). |
| [`dashboard/`](dashboard/README.md) | Plotly Dash dashboard — endurance + battery return-home. |
| [`sensors/`](sensors/README.md) | Sensor abstraction (interfaces + simulated), so guidance never touches a raw sensor. |

### 3. Baseline reference — the original self-built simulator
Superseded by ArduSoar for the onboard control loop, but **kept runnable** as a
baseline and because the dashboard still demos it:

| Dir | Role |
|---|---|
| `glider_model/` | kinematic glider (coordinated turn, bank-dependent sink) |
| `thermal_model/` | Gaussian thermal + changing-world `ThermalField` (drift / lifecycle / merge) |
| `thermal_estimator/` | rolling-window regularised least-squares thermal fit *(retired: ArduSoar's EKF replaces it)* |
| `controller/` | state machine, L1 guidance, cruise/probe/circling *(retired: ArduSoar replaces it)* |
| `simulator/`, `estimation/`, `monte_carlo/` | sim loop + plotting, state/wind fusion, robustness analysis |

The core soaring identity is shared across both worlds:

```
net climb:  h_dot  = w - v_s         (thermal lift minus sink rate)
vario:      w_meas = h_dot + v_s
thermal:    w(r)   = W_0 * exp(-r^2 / R_th^2)
```

## Run

**ArduSoar in SITL** (needs an ArduPilot SITL build + `soar-venv`; see
[`sitl/README.md`](sitl/README.md)):

```bash
sitl/run_demo.sh                 # reproduce ArduSoar thermalling in pure software
companion/run_companion_demo.sh  # weather hotspot -> fly there -> hand off to ArduSoar
```

**Weather pipeline** and **baseline simulator**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m weather.openmeteo_thermal     # Deardorff W* thermal prior from Open-Meteo
python main.py                          # baseline single-thermal sim + plots
python cross_country.py                 # baseline multi-thermal cross-country
python -m pytest tests                  # unit tests (59 passing)
```

## Status

- ✅ **Milestone 1** — ArduSoar thermalling reproduced in SITL (`sitl/`).
- ✅ **Step 3** — weather-guided companion: prior → hotspot → handoff, confirmed in SITL (`companion/`).
- ☐ Hardware bring-up (Matek F405-Wing-V2 + ASPD-4525 + Pi 5); see [`docs/`](docs/).
- ☐ Multi-hotspot cross-country under live weather.

Changes made in this derivative:
- Replaced the custom flight controller with ArduPilot / ArduSoar (no longer building a proprietary FC).
- Added a strategic thermal-prediction layer: real-weather prior (Open-Meteo W\*, SoaringMeteo GFS,
  terrain-trigger), ground path planner, MAVLink companion, and vision-feedback re-planner.
- Added SITL end-to-end validation, Pi 5 serial deployment, unit tests, and failsafe parameter sets.
- Retained the original simulation / estimator core for offline algorithm development.
